Hey there! [(Looking for the Blog? Click Here)](/blog)

**My name is Allan MacGregor**, and I'm a Software Engineer, Author and Technology enthusiast living in Toronto, Canada. 

I currently spend my working days as the **VP of Commerce Platforms** for a Digital Marketing Agency called **[Bounteous](https://bounteous.com/)**.

**On my spare time I love solving problems.** Whether it's figuring out the best way to tackle a complex problem or trying a new programming approach, I love the challenge of **finding a solution** or creating something new. 

My **love for writing** comes from a similar place, trying to find the best phrase or word to communicate an idea or a concept, and the **satisfaction** that comes with getting that right. If there is a **problem to solve** or a challenge to undertake then it's bound to be something I'll love doing.

This site is host to a variety of things both **professional** and **personal**; you can learn more about who I am, take a look at my [resume](/resume), or read both my [short-form](/blog) and [long form](https://amgr.dev) content, if you have any questions, you **can contact me** via [e-mail](mailto:info@allanmacgregor.com).
